# dataanalysis3

This is a repo for the Data Analysis 3 class at the University of Exeter (SOC2094/3094 POL2094/3094).

Please note that this is the repo for the 2018 module version. For 2019, please use https://github.com/dataanalysis3/datan3_2019

Folders:
- data: put the UndSoc data there (do not change anything, the next subfolder in data should be UKDA-6614-tab). Do not track this folder; it must be stored locally (this is why it doesn't show on Github)
- myData: put all the data you modify there. It is not tracked either.
- exData: I'll out the data for exercises there.
- outline: the module outline is there
- docs: all the html files used to build http://abessudnov.net/dataanalysis3/

All the scripts have been created with R Markdown. I used bookdown to turn this into a website that can be accessed here: http://abessudnov.net/dataanalysis3/
